- **Duration of Workflow Runs:** How long it takes for a pipeline to complete.
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of successful pipeline runs on the default branch.
- **Throughput:** The number of pipeline runs completed in a set period.
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery):** How quickly a team recovers from a pipeline failure.

Compare your CubeScore‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to industry benchmarks and aim for Elite Status to ensure your CI processes are optimized.
